       <h1>Final Project!!</h1>
       <p> 
        While I was deep in thought for my final project, I was watching "Avatar: The Last Airbender," one of my favorite shows as a child, and it struck me that this was the ideal idea.
        My idea was to create a decision chart game where players could choose their element there most close too and then be connected with one of the characters from that element.
        I decided to draw every character in the program, giving unique touch compared to just taking images from the web. The main idea of the program is to let users select an element that leads them into a customized story.
        I added dynamic game loop, handled inputs expertly, and created smooth transitions in order to create a seamless user experience. There are various stages to the journey, starting with the immersive introduction and ending with 
        the element selection. I really tried to make so anyone who watched the show would have a speical emotional bond between them and the character.
