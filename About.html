<p>
    To begin with, my ethnicity is Dominican. My parents are from the Dominican Republic, but I was born here.
     I enjoy sports such as football and basketball. Fun fact: my high school football team won the state championship.
      I consider myself to be quite passionate about many things. When I enjoy something, I put all of my energy to it.
       I consider myself to be an outgoing person who would thrive in a diverse environments. <br>

<p> I enjoy a lot of things. But listening to music is one of my favorite things to do. I feel a lot of peace when I listen to music. 
    R&B is the music genre I enjoy the most. As I listen to music, I can work out, study, and do many other things. 
    My absolute favorite musician is Brent Faiyaz, who is renowned for his R&B music.
    He has a lot of great hits, but in my opinion, Clouded is his best. Another thing I really enjoyed doing is playing video games. 
    I am able to get away from everything when I play video games. I can also play with friends whenever I want, which is something I enjoy doing. 
    Through games you are able to learn so much. I would play Call of Duty or Rocket League with friends all the time,
     which is something I really enjoy doing. <br>
